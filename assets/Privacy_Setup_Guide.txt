KATARU PRIVACY SETUP GUIDE

Kataru requires several permissions to function properly.
All processing happens locally on your Mac - no data is transmitted.

REQUIRED PERMISSIONS:
Kataru will request these permissions when first used:

1. INPUT MONITORING - For F5 hotkey detection
2. MICROPHONE - For speech recording 
3. AUTOMATION - For controlling System Events
4. ACCESSIBILITY - For pasting transcribed text

SETUP STEPS:
1. Launch Kataru from Applications
2. Press F5 - grant "Input Monitoring" when prompted
3. Press F5 again - grant "Microphone" when prompted
4. Speak and release F5 - grant "Automation" and "Accessibility" when prompted

TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If F5 doesn't work: Enable "Input Monitoring" in Privacy & Security
• If recording fails: Enable "Microphone" in Privacy & Security  
• If pasting fails with "Code 1" error: Enable BOTH "Automation" AND "Accessibility" in Privacy & Security
• IMPORTANT: Text pasting requires TWO permissions - both must be enabled
• If permissions reset after updates: Re-enable in Privacy & Security settings
• For support: help@kataru.app

PRIVACY GUARANTEE:
All speech processing happens locally on your device.
No audio or text data is ever transmitted to external servers.

Your privacy is fully protected with Kataru.
